The topic of the Dattack is creative use of data. How can we use open data sources for creative audio-visual expression? Where to look for data, what are the methods used to work with them; what tools can help turning data into visual, sonic and interactive experiences? Everybody is invited: visual and audio artists, designers, architects, developers and statisticians. 

3 of March is the international Open Data Day. Dattack is taking part in the celebration and is going to be one of the events supporting Open Data Day internationally. Open Data Day is an annual celebration of open data all over the world. For the seventh time in history, groups from around the world will create local events on the day where they will use open data in their communities. It is an opportunity to show the benefits of open data and encourage the adoption of open data policies in government, business and civil society.

On the first day, local and international experts from various fields are going to give presentations on how to look at data and use them for creative expression. Possibilities are endless and there it is going to be an attempt to show as many different perspectives as possible.

A hands-on workshop will take place during the second day. The participants are going to create real projects for the Staro Riga 2018 light festival taking place in Riga in November 2018. The organizers will take care of building the teams before and adjusting them during the event. The goal of the workshop is to create a realistic description and estimate of a spatial light project that has a certain place, time and duration. The most enthusiastic teams will be selected and the project executed as a part of the Staro Riga 2018 festival.
