Hannu's roots are deep in the Finnish information society. His first job was at Nokia at the end of the 1980s. An evolving and open information society needs its own players. "Hannes" (Hannu's nickname) joined the Pirate Party movement in 2009. He was setting up Open Knowledge Finland later and an OK chapter in Estonia.
