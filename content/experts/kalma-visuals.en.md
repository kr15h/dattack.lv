Kalma is a visual performer that used real time processes to create light installations, interactive sculptures, mappings and vj sets with unique atmospheres and unrepeatable experiences and new adventures from one moment to the next. Her work as a visual artist includes interactive installations, mapping and vjing, which she combines with her passion for teaching. Since 2010 she has been hosting and organising workshops around the topics of mapping and video in real time. Her creative pedagogic and practical approach generate the best ground for people willing to immerse in this endless possibilities field.
