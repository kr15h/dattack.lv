Margo is a siberian stage director from Riga, Latvia, specializing in multidisciplinary, often unconventional and ambitious approaches. She is a creator of plotless and dreamlike works, which she calls the “moving pain paintings”. She is interested in producing material for opera houses and operatic repertoire for festivals in Europe, Asia, Americas, Antarctica and Atlantis. Margo would love to keep interpreting Russian and Baroque musical heritage. The artist is passionate about architecture, anthropology, biology and expanding space-time with the help of music theatre. Rolling through the countless mentalities and world-views is her answer to the dismayed Western Europe.
