I am a stage director, specializing in multidisciplinary, often unconventional and ambitious approaches. I am a creator of plotless, dreamlike works, which I call “moving pain paintings”. I am interested in producing operatic repertoire for opera houses and festivals in Europe, Asia, Americas, Antarctica and Atlantis. I would love to keep interpreting Russian and Baroque musical heritage. I am passionate about architecture, anthropology, biology and expanding space-time with the help of music theatre. Rolling through countless mentalities and world-views is my answer to the dismayed Western Europe. I am a Siberian from Riga, Latvia. Born in 1980.
